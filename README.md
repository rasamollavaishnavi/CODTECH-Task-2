## Overview
Model evaluation is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline to ensure the selected model performs well on unseen data. This notebook demonstrates various evaluation techniques, such as calculating accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualizing metrics like confusion matrices and ROC curves.

## Features
1. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Generates confusion matrices and classification reports.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Plots ROC-AUC curves for binary classification models.
   - Displays precision-recall curves.

3. **Model Comparison:**
   - Evaluates multiple models side-by-side.
   - Highlights the best-performing model based on selected criteria.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations
  - `scikit-learn` for evaluation metrics and model utilities

## Workflow
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate models using test data.
   - Compare metrics across models.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize evaluation results for better interpretability.
